# Specification Quality Checklist: VPS Developer Workstation Provisioning

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: December 23, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Complete**: All checklist items passed. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Changes Made During Validation:
1. Removed specific implementation details from Assumptions section (XFCE, LXDE, xrdp, .deb, /var/log paths)
2. Cleaned up test scenarios to avoid command-specific references (apt install, systemctl)
3. Updated NFR Maintainability section to remove language specifications (Bash, Python)
4. Updated System Dependencies to remove specific tool names (systemd, apt/dpkg, ext4, useradd)
5. All sections now focus on WHAT and WHY rather than HOW
