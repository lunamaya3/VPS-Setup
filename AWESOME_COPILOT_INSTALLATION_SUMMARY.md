🎯 WHY THESE 3 INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR PROJECT
================================================================================

Your VPS developer workstation provisioning project benefits from these 
instructions because:

1. SHELL SCRIPTING GUIDELINES
   ✓ Your provisioning scripts are heavily shell/bash based
   ✓ Helps establish consistent shell script patterns
   ✓ Prevents common shell script errors and security issues
   ✓ Critical for VPS deployment automation safety

2. GITHUB ACTIONS CI/CD BEST PRACTICES
   ✓ Enables automated testing of provisioning scripts
   ✓ Supports CI/CD pipeline setup for VPS automation
   ✓ Helps validate changes before production deployment
   ✓ Integrates with your existing GitHub workflow

3. CODE REVIEW GENERIC
   ✓ Establishes standards for reviewing provisioning code
   ✓ Ensures security and quality before production deployment
   ✓ Provides frameworks for team collaboration on scripts
   ✓ Critical for a system provisioning tool (prevents unintended changes)
